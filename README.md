## The Story When Doing This Challenge

I will start with the `style-guide.md` file. This time it is showing me clearly on what color that I have to use. But, there are two font families which are [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) and [Lexend Deca](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Deca). It doesn't tell me when I need to use Lexend Deca or Inter.

So, I tried a couple times and then I found out that **COMPANIES**, **TEMPLATES**, and **QUERIES**, that needed `Lexend Deca`. The others text were `Inter`.

The hardest thing on this challenge was the purple overlay. You can use pseudo element, `background-blend-mode`, and `mix-blend-mode`. I used `mix-blend-mode`, because in my opinion it's using the `image` height. So, I didn't need to add `height` manually and it's simple.

Just write `mix-blend-mode: multiply` on img style and write `background-color` on it's parent element.

For the responsiveness, I used flexbox, but you could use grid if you wanted. There's no specific reason for that, it's just my personal preference.

## What I Learned
* Using `mix-blend-mode` property.
* I learned on how to use `picture` tag.

## Built With

This project is created using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Sass**.
