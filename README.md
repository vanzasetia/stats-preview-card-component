## The Story When Doing This Challenge

I found out that **COMPANIES**, **TEMPLATES**, and **QUERIES**, that needed `Lexend Deca`. The others text were `Inter`.

The hardest thing on this challenge was the purple overlay. You can use pseudo element, `background-blend-mode`, and `mix-blend-mode`. I used `mix-blend-mode`, because in my opinion it's using the `image` height. So, I didn't need to add `height` manually and it's simple.

Just write `mix-blend-mode: multiply` on img style and write `background-color` on it's parent element.

For the responsiveness, I used flexbox, but you could use grid if you wanted. There's no specific reason for that, it's just my personal preference.

## What I Learned

- Using `mix-blend-mode` property.
- I learned on how to use `picture` tag.

## Built With

This project is created using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Sass**.
